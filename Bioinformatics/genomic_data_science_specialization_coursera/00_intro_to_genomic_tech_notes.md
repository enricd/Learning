## Overview

### Why Genomics?

DNA -> (transcription) -> RNA -> (translation) -> Protein -> (proteins can also be used to regulate gene expression) -> Methylation

Each triplet produces an amino acid.

20 possible amino acids to produce proteins, the tipical protein has 300-400 amino acids.

In 2001, the human genome project was completed. It was a 13 year project that cost $3 billion. It was the first time that the entire human genome was sequenced.

The human genome has 3.1 billion base pairs.

The human genome contains 20,000 protein coding genes.

NCBI: National Center for Biotechnology Information (largest database of genomic information).


### What is Genomics?

The branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes. 

The human genome there is approximately 3.1 billion base pairs divided into 23 chromosomes.


### What is Genomic Data Science?

Biology - Statistics - Computer Science

Aligment and Assembly / Preprocessing and Normalization / Statistics and ML / Sw dev / Population genomics / Integrative genomics


## Molecular Biology

### Just enough cell biology
